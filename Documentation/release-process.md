# Releasing a new version of Cesium for Unreal

This is the process we follow when releasing a new version of Cesium for Unreal on GitHub and on the Unreal Engine Marketplace.

## Test the release candidate

* Verify that the cesium-native submodule in the `extern` directory references the expected commit of cesium-native. Update it if necessary. Verify that CI has completed successfully for that commit of cesium-native.
* Wait for CI to complete for the main branch. Verify that it does so successfully.
* Remove any existing copy of the Cesium for Unreal plugin from the engine plugins directory on your system. On Windows this is usually `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.26\Engine\Plugins\Marketplace`.
* Download the `UE4.27-AllPlatforms` or `UE4.26-AllPlatforms` for the `main` branch of cesium-unreal. Extract it to your Unreal Engine installation's engine plugins directory. 
* Clone a fresh copy of [cesium-unreal-samples](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples) to a new directory. Launch the Unreal Editor and open `CesiumForUnrealSamples.uproject` from the new cesium-unreal-samples directory.
* Open each level in Content -> CesiumSamples -> Maps and verify it works correctly:
  * Does it open without crashing?
  * Does it look correct?
  * Press Play. Does it work as expected? The billboard in each level should give you a good idea of what to expect.
* Using one of the sample scenes, open the foliage window and create a new foliage type using any engine static mesh. Verify that foliage painting on Cesium World Terrain works correctly.
* Test on other platforms and other versions of Unreal Engine if you can. If you can't (e.g., you don't have a Mac), post a message on Slack asking others to give it at least a quick smoke test.

If all of the above goes well, you're ready to release Cesium for Unreal.

## Update CHANGES.md and tag the cesium-native and cesium-unreal releases

While doing the steps below, make sure no new changes are going into either cesium-unreal or cesium-native that may invalidate the testing you did above. If new changes go in, it's ok, but you should either retest with those changes or make sure they are not included in the release.

* Change the version in `CesiumForUnreal.uplugin`:
  * Increment the `Version` integer property.
  * Change the `VersionName` property to the new three digit, dot-delimited version number. Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to pick the version number.
* Change the `version` property in `package.json` to match the `VersionName` above.
* Verify that cesium-native's CHANGES.md is complete and accurate.
* Verify that cesium-unreal's CHANGES.md is complete and accurate.
* Verify again that cesium-native CI has completed successfully on all platforms.
* Verify again that the submodule reference in cesium-unreal references the correction commit of cesium-native.
* Verify again that cesium-unreal CI has completed successfully on all platforms.
* Tag the cesium-native release, e.g., `git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "0.2.0 release"`
* Push the tag to github: `git push origin v0.2.0`
* Tag the cesium-unreal release, e.g., `git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "1.1.0 release"`
* Push the tag to github: `git push origin v1.1.0`

# Publish the release on GitHub

* Wait for the release tag CI build to complete.
* Download the tag's `plugin-package-combined`. You can find it by switching to the tag in the GitHub UI, clicking the green tick in the header, and then clicking the Details button next to `plugin-package-combined`. While you're here, copy the download URL because you'll need it later.
* Create a new release on GitHub: https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal/releases/new. Copy the changelog into it. Follow the format used in previous release. Upload the release ZIP that you downloaded above.

# Update Cesium for Unreal Samples

Assuming you tested the release candidate as described above, you should have [cesium-unreal-samples](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples) using the updated plugin. You'll use this to push updates to the project.

## Update ion Access Tokens and Project

1. Create a new branch of cesium-unreal-samples. 
2. Delete the Cesium for Unreal Samples token for the release before last, which should expire close to the present date.
3. Create a new access token using the CesiumJS ion account. 
   * The name of the token should match "Cesium for Unreal Samples x.x.x - Delete on September 1st, 2021". The expiry date should be two months later than present. 
   * The scope of the token should be "assets:read" for all assets.
4. Copy the access token you just created. 
5. Paste the new token into the `DefaultIonAccessToken` property in [Config/DefaultEngine.ini](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples/blob/main/Config/DefaultEngine.ini).
6. Open cesium-unreal-samples in Unreal Engine.
7. If the plugin update has replaced any Cesium blueprints that may already exist in one of the scenes, such as DynamicPawn, CesiumSunSky, or similar, replace the old version of the blueprint with the new version, and test the scene with the play button to make sure everything is working. If you're unsure whether the plugin update has resulted in anything that needs to be changed in the Samples, ask the team. 
8. Visit every scene again to make sure that the view is correct and that nothing appears to be missing. 
9. For 04_MAIN_CesiumSublevels, play the scene in editor to test for the following. 
   1. You'll start in Denver. Make sure the Denver Photogrammetry and CWT are showing and that there are no unexpected tilesets.
   2. Press "2". Make sure you fly to the Grand Canyon, you should see CWT only. Make sure there are no other unexpected tilesets.
   3. Press "3". Make sure you fly to Boston and CWT and the Boston Photogrammetry are showing. Make sure there are no other unexpected tilesets.
   4. Press "4". Make sure you fly to Paris, and CWT and OSM buildings are showing. Make sure there are no other unexpected tilesets.
   5. If no errors, return the camera to the starting view with the "1" key and close the scene without saving. 
10. Commit and push your changes. Create a PR to merge to `main` and tag a reviewer.

## Publish the Cesium for Unreal Samples release on GitHub

After the update has been merged to `main`, do the following:
1. Pull and check out the latest version of `main` from GitHub, and then tag the new release by doing the following:
  * `git tag -a v1.10.0 -m "v1.10.0 release"`
  * `git push origin v1.10.0`
2. Wait for the continuation integration build to complete for the tag.
3. Switch to the tag in the GitHub UI by visiting the repo, https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples, clicking the combo box where it says "main", switching to the Tags tab, and selecting the new tag that you created above.
4. Click the green tick ✔️ at the top of the list of files and click the "Details" link next to "project-package". This will download the built package to your computer. Also copy this URL (by right-clicking the Details link and choosing `Copy link address`) because you will need it later.
5. Create a new release on GitHub: https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples/releases/new. Select the tag you created above. Add a changelog in the body to describe recent updates. Follow the format used in previous release. 
6. Upload the release ZIP that you downloaded above.
7. Publish the release.

## Publish Cesium for Unreal Samples on Marketplace

DO NOT do this step until Epic has accepted the updated plugin! Because if you do, Epic may end up releasing this update on the Marketplace before the plugin itself is updated. Because the updated Samples project is not guaranteed to work with old versions of the plugin, this can leave users in a broken state. On the other hand, the plugin is usually backward compatible, so that old Samples will work fine with the new plugin. Thus, we should always make sure the plugin is published to the Marketplace first.

1. Open https://publish.unrealengine.com/v2/products. Login with the admin credentials.
2. Navigate to **Products -> Published**.
3. Select **Cesium for Unreal Samples**, then scroll all the way to the bottom to the **Product Files** section.
4. Click the **Submit File Update** button. Confirm the prompts, and you will be directed to this page below.
    * A note here - The **Create New Version** button (don't use this) is for adding a plugin that is for a different version of Unreal Engine. For example if there were different build for 4.25 and 4.26. Even if you accidentally click it, the box for 4.26 will be greyed out. Delete the accidentally added row by clicking the delete icon.
5. Do the following to update the plugin:
    1. Update the Version Title to match the release version.
    2. Replace the Project File Link with the download link you copied from the github continuation integration green tick.
    3. Confirm the supported Unreal Engine versions.
    4. Confirm the supported platforms.
    5. Replace the Version Notes with the link to the published release.(Likely `https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples/releases/tag/vX.X.X`)

6. Click **Submit**.
7. This should take you back to the product page, and the **Product Files** section should show **View Pending File Update**. The admin will also recieve an email confirming the submission.
