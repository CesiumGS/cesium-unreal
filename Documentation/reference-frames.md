# Reference Frames

This is an inventory of the most important reference frames used in Cesium for Unreal.

## Ellipsoid-centered

This is the "native" reference frame of Cesium.

|  |  |
|----------|----------|
| *Handedness* | Right |
| *Units* | Meters |
| *Origin* | Center of the ellipsoid (Earth) |
| *Orientation* | <ul><li>+X passes through the intersection of the equator and prime meridian (0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude)</li><li>+Y passes through the intersection of the equator and +90 degrees longitude (0 degrees latitude, 90 degrees longitude)</li><li>+Z is up through the North Pole</li></ul> |

## Georeferenced

A reference frame defined by the `ACesiumGeoreference` actor.

|  |  |
|----------|----------|
| *Handedness* | Right |
| *Units* | Meters |
| *Origin* | The origin defined by the `ACesiumGeoreference::OriginPlacement` and possibly `OriginLongitude`, `OriginLatitude`, and `OriginHeight` properties. |
| *Orientation* | <ul><li>If `ACesiumGeoreference::AlignTilesetUpWithZ` is _true_: <ul><li>+X points East at the origin</li><li>+Y points North at the origin</li><li>+Z is in the direction of the ellipsoid surface normal at the origin (up)</li></ul> </li><li>If `ACesiumGeoreference::AlignTilesetUpWithZ` is _false_: <ul><li>Same as Ellipsoid-centered above.</li></ul> </li></ul> |

## Cesium Tileset

The reference frame of a Cesium 3D Tiles tileset, as defined by the tileset.json. Usually, tilesets are georeferenced and this reference frame is identical to the `Ellipsoid-centered` frame described above, but this is not strictly required by 3D Tiles. A non-georeferenced model of a building, for example, may have an origin at the center of the building and axes aligned with the principal sides of the building.

|  |  |
|----------|----------|
| *Handedness* | Right |
| *Units* | Meters |
| *Origin* | Specified by tileset.json, often the center of the Earth. |
| *Orientation* | Specified by tileset.json, often ECEF. |


## Unreal Tileset

The same as the Cesium Tileset, but expressed in Unreal Engine terms: the coordinates are in centimeters (multiplied by 100.0) and left-handed (have an inverted Y component) relative to Cesium Tileset coordinates.

Please note that the transformation from Unreal Tileset coordinates to Unreal Absolute/Relative World (below) is affected by the ACesium3DTileset Actor's Location and Orientation properties. However, these should almost always be set to identity.

|  |  |
|----------|----------|
| *Handedness* | Left |
| *Units* | Centimeters |
| *Origin* | Specified by tileset.json, often the center of the Earth. |
| *Orientation* | Specified by tileset.json, often ECEF. |

## Unreal Absolute World

Vectors and matrices in Unreal Engine are expressed using single-precision floating-point numbers. In order to maintain precision, these coordinate values must remain relatively small. To support this, the Unreal floating world origin can be moved by setting the `OriginLocation` property of `UWorld`. Coordinates that are said to be in the "Unreal Absolute World" reference frame are expressed relative to the absolute origin (0,0,0) and are not affected by the value of the `OriginLocation` property.

|  |  |
|----------|----------|
| *Handedness* | Left |
| *Units* | Centimeters |
| *Origin* | No fixed meaning. |
| *Orientation* | No fixed meaning. |

## Unreal Relative World

This reference frame has the same orientation as "Unreal Absolute World", but is offset from it by the `UWorld`'s `OriginLocation`. Coordinates are expressed relative to the floating origin.

|  |  |
|----------|----------|
| *Handedness* | Left |
| *Units* | Centimeters |
| *Origin* | No fixed meaning. |
| *Orientation* | No fixed meaning. |
