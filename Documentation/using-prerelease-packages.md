# Using Pre-Release Packages

Cesium for Unreal has a continous integration (CI) system that automatically builds an installable version of the plugin for every commit in every branch.



If you would like to access pre-release, development versions of the plugin, Cesium for Unreal is automatically built from each commit, branch, and pull request. To access these packages, click the ✔️ icon on the GitHub branch or commit and click the `Details` link next to any of the checks in the box that appears. Then click "Summary" link near the top-left corner. Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section and look for an appropriate artifact for your Unreal Engine version. Note that artifacts that name a platform will _only_ work on that platform, while artifacts without any platform in the name will work on _all_ platforms that Cesium for Unreal supports.
