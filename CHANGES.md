# Change Log

### v1.1.1 - ?

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Moved the `BodyInstance` property on `Cesium3DTileset` to the `Collision` category so that it can be modified in the Editor.

### v1.1.0 - 2021-04-19

##### Additions :tada:

- Added macOS support.
- Added support for the legacy `gltfUpAxis` property in a tileset `asset` dictionary. Although this property is **not** part of the specification, there are many existing assets that use this property and had been shown with a wrong rotation otherwise.
- Changed the log level for the tile selection output from `Display` to `Verbose`. With default settings, the output will no longer be displayed in the console, but only written to the log file.
- Added more diagnostic details to error messages for invalid glTF inputs.
- Added diagnostic details to error messages for failed OAuth2 authorization with `CesiumIonClient::Connection`.
- Added a `BodyInstance` property to `Cesium3DTileset` so that collision profiles can be configured.
- Added an experimental "Exclusion Zones" property to `Cesium3DTileset`. While likely to change in the future, it already provides a way to exclude parts of a 3D Tiles tileset to make room for another.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Gave glTFs created from quantized-mesh terrain tiles a more sensible material with a `metallicFactor` of 0.0 and a `roughnessFactor` of 1.0. Previously the default glTF material was used, which has a `metallicFactor` of 1.0, leading to an undesirable appearance.
- Reported zero-length images as non-errors, because `BingMapsRasterOverlay` purposely requests that the Bing servers return a zero-length image for non-existent tiles.
- 3D Tiles geometric error is now scaled by the tile's transform.
- Fixed a bug that that caused a 3D Tiles tile to fail to refine when any of its children had an unsupported type of content.
- The `Material` property of `ACesium3DTiles` is now a `UMaterialInterface` instead of a `UMaterial`, allowing more flexibility in the types of materials that can be used.
- Fixed a possible crash when a `Cesium3DTileset` does not have a `CesiumGeoreference` or it is not valid.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.1.0 to v0.2.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.
