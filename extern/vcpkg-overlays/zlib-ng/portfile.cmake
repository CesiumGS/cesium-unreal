        # Disable ARMv6 instructions. We don't need this because we only run on 64-bit ARM (v8),
        # which has better instructions. zlib-ng has a bug that makes it try to use these v6
        # instructions even though they're not available. An attempt to fix it was made in this
        # PR: https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng/pull/1617
        # But it doesn't work in our Android builds because the dependent option
        # "NOT ARCH STREQUAL \"aarch64\"" that is meant to set `WITH_ARMV6` to FALSE is not
        # triggered because our ARCH is `aarch64-none-linux-android21`. It's not clear if this
        # is something quirky about our environment or if the fix is just not robust.
        # Either way, forcing WITH_ARMV6=OFF here fixes the problem and should be reasonable
        # on all platforms that Cesium for Unreal supports.
