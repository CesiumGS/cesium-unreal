# Submitting an Issue

If you have a question, do not submit an issue; instead, search the [Cesium community forum](https://community.cesium.com/). The forum is very active and there are years of informative archives for the Cesium platform, often with answers from the core Cesium team. If you do not find an answer to your question, start a new thread and you'll likely get a quick response.

If you think you've found a bug in Cesium for Unreal, first search the [issues](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal/issues). If an issue already exists, please add a comment expressing your interest and any additional information. This helps us prioritize issues.

If a related issue does not exist, submit a new one. Please be concise and include as much of the following information as is relevant:

- The version of Cesium for Unreal. Did this work in a previous version?
- Your operating system and version, Unreal Engine version, and video card. Are they all up-to-date? Is the issue specific to one of them?
- If possible, an Unreal project (and data or IDs of Cesium ion assets that have been used) where the issue can be reproduced.
- Can the issue be reproduced in the [Cesium for Unreal Samples](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples)?
- A Screenshot, video or animated .gif if appropriate. Screenshots are particularly useful for exceptions and rendering artifacts.
- Information about whether the issue appeared in the Unreal Editor or in the play mode.
- If the issue is about a crash of the Unreal Editor, include the stack trace that is shown together with the error message.
- Depending on the type of the issue, it can be helpful to see the log files that have been created before encountering the unexpected behavior. The log files is stored as `Saved\Logs\cesiumunreal.log` in your project directory.
- A link to the thread if this was discussed on the [Cesium community forum](https://community.cesium.com/) or elsewhere.
- Ideas for how to fix or workaround the issue. Also mention if you are willing to help fix it. If so, the Cesium team can often provide guidance and the issue may get fixed more quickly with your help.
