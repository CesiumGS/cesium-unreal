# Contribution Guide {#contributing-unreal}

Thanks for contributing to Cesium for Unreal!

<!--!

Here are the guidelines that we use for all contributions to this project:

- [Submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue),
- [Getting started contributing](#getting-started-contributing)
- [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request)

To ensure an inclusive community, contributors and users in the Cesium community should follow the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Submitting an Issue {#submitting-an-issue}

If you have a question, **do not submit an issue**. Instead, search the [Cesium community forum](https://community.cesium.com/) for your question. The forum is very active and there are years of informative archives for the Cesium platform, often with answers from the core Cesium team. If you do not find an answer to your question, start a new thread and you'll likely get a quick response.

If you think you've found a bug in Cesium for Unreal, first search the existing [issues](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal/issues). If an issue already exists, please add a **comment** expressing your interest and any additional information. This helps us stay organized and prioritize issues.

If a related issue does not exist, then you can submit a new one. Please include as much of the following information as is relevant:

- What version of Cesium for Unreal were you using? Do other versions have the same issue?
- What version of Unreal Engine were you using?
- What is your operating system and version, and your video card? Are they up-to-date? Is the issue specific to one of them?
- Can the issue be reproduced in the [Cesium for Unreal Samples](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples)?
- Does the issue occur in the Unreal Editor? In Play Mode? Both?
- Are there any error messages in the console? Any stack traces or logs? Please include them if so. Logs are stored as `Saved\Logs\cesiumunreal.log` in your project directory.
- Share a screenshot, video or animated `.gif` if appropriate. Screenshots are particularly useful for exceptions and rendering artifacts.
- Link to threads on the [Cesium community forum](https://community.cesium.com/) if this was discussed on there.
- Include step-by-step instructions for us to reproduce the issue from scratch.
- Any ideas for how to fix or workaround the issue. Also mention if you are willing to help fix it. If so, the Cesium team can often provide guidance and the issue may get fixed more quickly with your help.

**Note**: It is difficult for us to debug everyone's individual projects. We can triage issues faster when we receive steps to reproduce the issue from scratchâ€”either from [Cesium for Unreal Samples](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal-samples) or from a blank project. We will only request your Unreal project and/or data as a last resort.
