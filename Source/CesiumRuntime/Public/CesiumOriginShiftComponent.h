 *
 * This component is typically attached to a camera or Pawn. By default, it only
 * shifts the origin when entering a new sub-level (a Level Instance Actor with
 * a CesiumSubLevelComponent attached to it). By changing the Mode and Distance
 * properties, it can also shift the origin continually when in between
 * sub-levels (or when not using sub-levels at all).
 *
 * It is essential to add a CesiumGlobeAnchorComponent to all other non-globe
 * aware objects in the level; otherwise, they will appear to move when the
 * origin is shifted. It is not necessary to anchor objects that are in
 * sub-levels, because the origin remains constant for the entire time that a
 * sub-level is active.
