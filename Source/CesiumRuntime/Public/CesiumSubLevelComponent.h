/**
 * A component intended to be attached to a Level Instance Actor that turns that
 * Level Instance into a Cesium sub-level. Only a single Cesium sub-level can be
 * active (visible) at any given time.
 *
 * A globe (like the planet Earth) is an unusual sort of level in Unreal in that
 * it has truly massive coordinate values and the "up" direction depends on
 * where exactly on the globe you're located. Many things in the Unreal
 * ecosystem, such as the gravity system, don't expect this situation and will
 * have incorrect and surprising behavior when used on a globe.
 *
 * Cesium sub-levels help to mitigate this. Only one sub-level can be active at
 * any given time, and when it is, that sub-level's origin becomes the origin of
 * the Unreal world. Furthermore, at the origin location, Unreal's +X axis
 * points East, its +Y axis points South, and its +Z axis points Up. Thus,
 * within a sub-level, gravity works in the normal way that Unreal objects
 * expect, and coordinate values stay relatively small. This allows you to use
 * just about any Unreal object within a sub-level without worrying about
 * surprising behavior.
 *
 * Globe-aware objects, particularly those with a "Cesium Globe Anchor"
 * component attached to them, are allowed to exist outside sub-levels and even
 * move between them. If all your objects are globe aware, there's no need to
 * use sub-levels at all.
 *
 * In the Editor, the currently-active sub-level is selected by clicking the
 * "Eye" icon next to the Level Instance in the Outliner.
 *
 * At runtime, the currently-active sub-level is selected by the Actor with a
 * CesiumOriginShiftComponent attached to it. If this Actor is inside a
 * sub-level's "Load Radius" that sub-level will be activated. If multiple
 * sub-levels are in range, only the closest one will be activated.
