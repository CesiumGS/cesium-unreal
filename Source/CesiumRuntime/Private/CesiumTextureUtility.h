// lifetime of our textures because it doesn't run often enough (and not at all
// in the Editor). And we also need shared ownership of UTexture2Ds when a tile
// is "upsampled" from its parent for raster overlays. So this class allows us
// to control the lifetime of a UTexture2D via reference counting.
//
// Yes, this means we're controlling the lifetime of a garbage collected
// `UTexture2D` object via reference counting.
//
// Instances of this class are created whenever we create a UTexture2D. A
// pointer to the instance is held in `LoadedTextureResult` as well as in a
// private extension added to the glTF `Texture` from which the UTexture2D was
// created.
